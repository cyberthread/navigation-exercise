In this exercise you will practice implementing key navigational elements to help audience members know where they are and what other options are available to them. This exercise has 3 HTML pages. Use Rebecca's [Navigation Demo Code](https://github.com/cyberthread/basic_HTML_navigation) for reference. 

Your tasks include:

- [ ] Provide assistive technology users the option to skip right to the main content of the page (on each page)
- [ ] Notify audience members of what page they are on in 3 ways
    - [ ] Title each document so that the audience knows what page of what site they are on
    - [ ] Use aria-current to indicate to assitive technology users what page they are on from within the navigation
    - [ ] Use clear h1 tags on each page to indicate where the audience member is in the content
- [ ] Create a back to top hyperlink at the bottom of each page that jumps to the top of the main content area

Submit the following on Blackboard:
- [ ] URL to live working website (all links work correctly from each page)
- [ ] Screenshot of validation service indicating valid code for each page (3 screen shots in total)
